# Coding Exercises and Projects

Welcome to my collection of coding exercises and personal projects completed as part of my learning journey with **Codedex**.  
Here you'll find all my work neatly organized by programming language, ranging from small practice tasks to complete mini-projects.

This repository serves both as a portfolio of what I've learned so far and as a way to track my progress over time.

## Contents

Each project or exercise is placed in its own folder, categorized by language or topic to keep everything structured and easy to navigate.  
Whether you're curious, learning yourself, or just browsing, feel free to dive in and explore the different folders.

## Example Folder Structure

- `java/` — Java projects and exercises  
- `README.md` — This file

## How to Use

Open the folders to view the individual code files.  
You can download, run, or adapt the code in your own development environment.  
If you're learning too, feel free to use this as inspiration or compare with your own solutions.

*This repository is a work in progress, and I'll keep adding new code as I continue my Codedex journey and expand my programming knowledge.*
